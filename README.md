# c_coding
This is a mix of things about C Coding. Mixing a Piscine from 42, Algorithms from YT and "unit testing".


## The Idea here is:

1 - to do the exercises, in the closest way according to Ã‰cole 42 requirements.
2 - Redo the exercises with alternative code (not refactoring, just alternatives, better or worse).
3 - Refactor the code. (newer alternatives, but with better code).
4 - Try some intermediate techniques:
  a - Data Structures.
  b - Algorithms.
5 - Unit testing, integration testing:
  a - With bash (just, something simple, to get by).
  b - In C (making my own simple testing from scratch).
  c - With a test-suite (ex.: CUnit. Proper testing techniques).
6 - Apply advance techniques:
  a - Data Structures.
  b - Algorithms.
  c - Design Patterns.
  d - SOLID principle.
  e - Agile/Scrum like project management methodologies.
